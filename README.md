# TCN-BiLSTM-CE

### This github repository is used to reproduce the results of the model reconstructed for missing values in energy load data, TCN-BiLSTM-CE, including three python scripts:
#### load_data.py: Normalizing and Preprocessing the training data and model the training data and test data with sliding window
#### model_and_training.py: Modeling, compiling and training the TCN-BiLSTM-CE model and saving the trained model
#### test.py: Validating with test data

### Selected building in this dataset:
#### Bear_public_Orville, Bear_public_Rayna, Mouse_health_Ileana, Mouse_health_Estela, Hog_office_Denita, Hog_office_Napoleon, Wolf_retail_Toshia, Panther_retail_Kristina, Panther_parking_Lorriane, Panther_parking_Alaina, Panther_education_Teofila, Panther_education_Jerome

### Due to the data protection requirements of Green Fusion GmbH in Berlin, we can only provide the electrical load data here to make the results of the TCN-BiLSTM-CE reproducible.
