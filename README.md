# TCN-BiLSTM-CE

#### This github repository is used to reproduce the results of the model reconstructed for missing values in energy load data, TCN-BiLSTM-CE, including three python scripts:
###### load_data.py: Normalizing and Preprocessing the training data and model the training data and test data with sliding window
###### model_and_training.py: Modeling, compiling and training the TCN-BiLSTM-CE model and saving the trained model
###### test.py: Validating with test data
